R7. Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

There are people with sufficient knowledge and expertise to create valuable courses for people but do not have the financial resources to motivate them or to commit to creating a project without any funding. 

There are also people that are interested in taking a course and want to buy it but they can't find a particular course for the subject they're interested in either because it is too niche or it just hasn't been created yet at an affordable price point.

The marketplace aims to solve the problem of the above sellers and buyers by allowing buyers to recommend or request for particular courses to be created and then sellers or creators of the course will be able to post their course idea, credentials and funding that they require to get the course started. By funding or backing the creation of a course will give you perks such as early access, full access to the course for free or a discounted rate once the full course is released. Sellers will be able to gauge interest in particular courses by looking at the requested courses or even create a course solely based on that.

There are alternatives to this marketplace such as Gofundme and kickstarter but none that tailor specifically to the creation of learning materials and provide a place to request for courses that you wish to have created. 

R8. Why is a problem that needs solving

It's a problem that needs solving as there seems to be a disconnect between courses offered and what learners are actually looking for. It is difficult to create a one size fits all approach but having buyers wanting specific topics will allow course creators to make a more well rounded course that is inclusive of topics that a learner would like and it gives the chance for teachers with niche skills to potentially understand that there is a market for their skills. School based learning is far from a tailored approach given resource constraints so as adults that have the ability to learn at our own pace and find specific teaching styles that match our learning styles it gives an opportunity to have a more learned, informed and cohesive community.

R9. LINK TO DEPLOYED WEBSITE

R10. A link to your GitHub repository (repo).
- Ensure the repo is accessible by your Educators

R11. Description of your marketplace app (website), including:
- Purpose
    - To provide an environment where students (buyers of courses) can request for particular courses and back teachers (creators of courses) with the financial resources required for them to start and complete a course where they wouldn't or couldn't otherwise complete.
- Functionality / features
    - Idea board where people post up what courses they would like to see or topics that they would like to learn about. Teachers can then comment and link their potential course to be backed 
    - Ability for sellers to post up a potential course and the required resources for them to start or complete the course along with descriptions of their credentials and overview of what the course will contain
    - Ability for buyers to back course creators with a donation of their choice and receive perks in return
    - Visualisation of the amount of funds required for a course to be backed and how far along they are 
    - Payment system to allow the backing of funds 
    - Individualised accounts for sellers and buyers
- Sitemap
- Screenshots
- Target audience
    - Students of all ages are the target audience as they voice what sort of courses they are looking for and they can also advise how much they're willing to pay on idea boards and people with technical knowledge that can create a course but are unsure of whether their course will have an audience or they don't have the financial means or incentives to start/complete the course
- Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)
    - HTML, CSS, Heroku, Ruby on Rails

R12. User stories for your App

R13. Wireframes for your App

R14. ERD for your App

R15. Explain the different high level components (abstractions) in your app

R16. Detail any third party services your app will use 

R17. Describe your projects models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other

R18. Discuss the database relations to be implemented in your application

R19. Provide your database schema design

R20. Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project
Tasks have been allocated and broken down in a Trello board as cards where I can track what tasks are still to be completed for the project, which tasks are currently ongoing and which tasks have been completed. Tasks will be added as they are discovered during the course of the project as well. For version control and tracking Github will be used. 

To further break this down, tasks have been created based on the user stories that have been created based on the agile methodology such that we have tasks that are specifically designed to create a working product as soon as possible. Styling tasks are created based on the wireframes that have been created to narrow down the scope and depth in which we will need to style our app and what potential tools we will ultimately utilise such as Bootstrap, Tailwind or just manual CSS. Our coding tasks will be created based on the ERD and user stories as we plan the relationships between or models to allow us to understand and track whether we have completed the task with sufficient functionality. 

All of this can be tracked via trello by creating cards with descriptions and adding more cards as new tasks appear as our scope will almost inevitably increase. 

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
